                            <p><strong>Immediate  relief</strong>: Nepal was hit by major earthquakes, measuring 7.8 and 7.4 on the Richter scale on April 25, 2015 and May 12, 2015 respectively. Many parts of the country were severely affected and there
                                were more than 9,000 casualties and almost 2.8 million people were rendered homeless. The quake also set-off an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 21 people and marking it as the deadliest day in the history of the mountain.
                                Amongst the 39 districts that were affected, Sindhupalchok was the worst hit.</p>
                            <p>The Vasundhara Sanstha, in partnership with India&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.akshayapatra.org/" target="_blank">Akshaya Patra&nbsp; Foundation</a> and Nepal&rsquo;s
                                <!--<a href="http://sipradiansahayata.com/" target="_blank">Sipradian Sahayata Sanstha</a>-->(SSS), expeditiously set up a centralised community kitchen in Bhaktapur from where 18,000 meals a day were provided to victims in 17 shelter camps in Bhaktapur and Kathmandu districts. The centralised community kitchen
                                operated for 91 days from June 19, 2015 to September 17, 2015 and served to close to 1.4 million meals to affected communities.</p>
                            <p>Post-earthquake rehabilitation activities in Nepal: After undertaking immediate relief activities, the Trusts proceeded to undertake a long-term plan focusing on restoration of infrastructure that was destroyed in the disaster.
                                The objectives of the project are to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Improve infrastructure for education by constructing permanent structures for six government schools for children in Sindhupalchowk district</li>
                                <li>Increase the number of gender-friendly toilets in schools</li>
                                <li>Strengthen the education system by providing school materials and psychosocial counselling for making learning fun</li>
                                <li>Promote water and sanitation and hygiene (WASH) behaviour among the students and the community in the catchment area. As part of the project, the Trusts are facilitating the reconstruction of seven secondary schools and
                                    one health post.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Four schools have been reconstructed with a modern layout resistant to earthquakes and designed with disabled-friendly facilities. The April 2015 earthquake had badly damaged the schools, destroying the classrooms, science
                                lab and other facilities at school. The well-furnished, earthquake-resistant school buildings have been handed over to the community.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>School building complying to specifications advocated for earthquake seismic zone 5, with a modern layout.</li>
                                <li>Classrooms complying to global standards, w.r.t safety, space per child, access to differently-abled child, etc.</li>
                                <li>Community participation during the reconstruction phase and corpus fund equally contributed by the community and local partner created to support post-construction maintenance of the structure.</li>
                                <li>WASH infrastructure with soft activities to equip students w.r.t personal hygiene and safe drinking water through IEC / BCC tools.</li>
